# Mosquitto MQTT server for windows (ready to use version)

Original app installation requires downloading some ddl files and copying to the app dir. Too lazy to that, i found an tutorial article (will paste the link later when i find it again :lol: ) and downloaded the ready-to-use version of it.

Files in this repo has been downloaded from some tutorial page some dude written(I will find the link and paste it here later). Since original setup became a hussle to me, i put the ready-to-use version here. I did not checked for viruses or other stuff, instead i'm using this in my sandboxed VM (W7). 

@Todo: find the tutorial link
@Todo: add how to instructions for simple use cases like: starting up the server, securing it with password, adding ssl/tls secure layer etc.



Below is the original app readme:
